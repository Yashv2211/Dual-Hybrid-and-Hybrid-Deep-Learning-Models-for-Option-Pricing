# Dual-Hybrid-and-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Option-Pricing

Options have been priced through mathematical models and methods, most popularly the Black-Scholes Model. This dissertation observes the performance of different Deep Learning methods ( MLP, CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Dual-hybrid Jump-Diffusion CNN- LSTM) artificial, taking into consideration the effect of different volatilities while training it. The model trains and predicts option prices on the Russell 2000 and the NASDAQ 100 Index from 1st Jan 2012 to 30th Dec 2021. I compare the empirical pricing error of the Deep Learning models to the Black Scholes model and among themselves. As well as the performance of all the models on different volatilities in an attempt to identify the best for training deep learning models for predicting option prices. I study the performance of the models as well as their generalizability as I test their performance on a different dataset, i.e the NASDAQ 100 Index (the models are trained on the Russell 2000 index). I devise a dual hybrid model in an attempt to see if the traditional mathematical model( the Merton-Jump-Diffusion model) along with a deep learning model (the CNN-LSTM model) prices European-style options better than other deep learning methods.
